## Code Style

### Go Code

- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add comments for public APIs
- Keep functions small and focused
- Write tests for new functionality

### Web UI

- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Follow the existing component structure
- Write unit tests for components
- Update documentation for new features

## Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
make test

# Run specific module tests
cd mobius-server && go test ./...
cd mobius-web && npm test
```

### Writing Tests

- Write unit tests for all new functionality
- Use table-driven tests in Go where appropriate
- Mock external dependencies
- Ensure tests are deterministic

## Documentation

- Update relevant documentation for changes
- Use clear, concise language
- Include code examples where helpful
- Update API documentation for new endpoints

## Code Review Process

1. All code changes require review
2. Reviewers will check for:
   - Code quality and style
   - Test coverage
   - Documentation updates
   - Security considerations
3. Address review feedback promptly
4. Squash commits before merging if requested

## Release Process

Releases are managed by maintainers:
1. Version bumps follow [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/)
2. Changes are documented in CHANGELOG.md
3. Releases are tagged and published automatically
