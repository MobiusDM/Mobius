# Images Organization

This directory contains all static images for the Mobius website, cleaned up and organized.

## Directory Structure

```text

├── logos/
│   └── mobius/             # Main Mobius brand logos (THE REAL ONES)
├── icons/
│   └── apps/              # Application icons (60x60@2x format)
├── docs/                  # Documentation-related images
├── permanent/             # Permanent URLs (never move/rename these)

└── press-kit/             # Press kit assets
```

## Main Mobius Logos

The **actual** Mobius brand logos are located in `logos/mobius/`:

- `Mobius_Logo.png` - Main Mobius logo (266KB)
- `Mobius-Logo-Text_1.png` - Mobius logo with text (72KB)

These are the **real** logos copied from the parent directory, not the various duplicated/variant versions.

## Usage Guidelines

1. **Mobius Logos**: Use logos from `logos/mobius/` for official branding
2. **App Icons**: Standardized 60x60@2x format in `icons/apps/`
3. **Permanent Images**: Never move or rename files in `permanent/`
4. **Documentation**: Images for docs/tutorials in `docs/`

## Maintenance

- The main Mobius logos are the source of truth
- App icons are preserved for website functionality
- Most other logo variants/duplicates have been removed as "trash"
- Keep this directory clean and organized

## Recent Changes

- **July 2025**: Major cleanup - removed hundreds of duplicate/trash images
- Added the actual main Mobius logos from parent directory
- Preserved essential app icons and documentation images
- Removed excessive logo variants and UI clutter
