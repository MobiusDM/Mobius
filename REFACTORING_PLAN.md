# Mobius Backend Refactoring Plan

## Current Structure Analysis

### What we have:
- `backend/internal/server` - **Core server functionality** (needs to be moved out of "internal")
- `backend/cmd/mobius` - Main Mobius server executable  
- `backend/cmd/mobiuscli` - Mobius CLI tool
- Client logic mixed in server code (needs separation)
- Single Docker image builds both components
- JavaScript/frontend logic that should be removed

### What needs to change:
1. ✅ Separate Mobius Server and Mobius CLI into distinct products
2. ✅ Move components out of backend folder to root level  
3. ✅ **Remove "internal" designation** - Server logic should be the main product
4. ✅ **Pure API structure** - Remove all JavaScript/frontend logic
5. ✅ **CLI contacts server via API** - Pure API-based communication
6. ✅ **Separate client logic** - Extract to mobius-client folder
7. ✅ **Add mobius-cocoon** - Storefront folder for future development
8. ✅ **Three Docker images** - Server, CLI, and combined builds

## New Structure (Updated)

## Migration Steps

### Phase 1: Create New Structure ✅
1. ✅ Create `mobius-server/` directory
2. ✅ Create `mobius-cli/` directory  
3. ✅ Create `shared/` directory
4. ✅ Create `mobius-client/` directory
5. ✅ Create `mobius-cocoon/` directory

### Phase 2: Move Server Components ✅
1. ✅ Move `backend/cmd/mobius/` → `mobius-server/cmd/mobius/`
2. ✅ Move `backend/internal/` → `mobius-server/server/` (**removed "internal"**)
3. ✅ Move `backend/pkg/` → `mobius-server/pkg/` (server-specific packages)
4. ✅ Move `backend/api/` → `mobius-server/api/`
5. ✅ Create new `mobius-server/go.mod`

### Phase 3: Move CLI Components ✅
1. ✅ Move `backend/cmd/mobiuscli/` → `mobius-cli/cmd/mobiuscli/`
2. ✅ Extract shared packages to `shared/pkg/`
3. ✅ Create new `mobius-cli/go.mod`
4. ✅ **COMPLETE**: CLI now uses pure API calls to server

### Phase 4: Extract Client Logic ✅
1. ✅ Identify client-related code in osquery-perf
2. ✅ Move client logic to `mobius-client/`
3. ✅ Create client executable structure
4. ✅ **COMPLETE**: Client communicates with server via API as load testing tool

### Phase 5: Remove Frontend/JavaScript Logic ✅
1. ✅ Identify JavaScript dependencies (sockjs, websockets)
2. ✅ **COMPLETE**: Distinguished API vs frontend websockets
3. ✅ **COMPLETE**: Ensured pure API-only structure
4. ✅ **COMPLETE**: Preserved legitimate API websockets, removed frontend mixing

### Phase 6: Fix Import Paths ✅
1. ✅ Update all imports in mobius-server (removed internal/server → server)
2. ✅ Update all imports in mobius-cli  
3. ✅ Update go.mod files with correct module paths
4. ✅ Update shared package imports

### Phase 7: Create Docker Images ✅
1. ✅ `mobius-server/Dockerfile` - builds only server
2. ✅ `mobius-cli/Dockerfile` - builds only CLI
3. ✅ `mobius-client/Dockerfile` - builds only client
4. ✅ `Dockerfile.combined` - builds server+CLI together
5. ✅ **COMPLETE**: All Docker infrastructure ready

### Phase 8: Initialize Mobius Cocoon ✅
1. ✅ Create basic Go module structure
2. ✅ Add placeholder files and basic web server
3. ✅ Document future storefront plans

### Phase 9: Update Build Scripts ✅
1. ✅ Update CI/CD to build separate images (server, cli, client, combined)
2. ✅ Update build workflows for multi-platform support
3. ✅ **COMPLETE**: All build infrastructure ready
4. ✅ **COMPLETE**: Documentation structure in place

## Important Notes

### ⚠️ DO NOT REMOVE `internal/server`
The `backend/internal/server` is **NOT** an internal hosting page. It contains:
- All API endpoints (`/api/v1/mobius/*`)
- MDM functionality
- OSQuery integration
- Device management
- Authentication/authorization
- Database operations
- Core business logic

This is the **heart of the Mobius server** and removing it would break everything.

### Frontend Clarification
The current "frontend" is just a minimal HTML status page served by the server. The real frontend will be:
1. **Server-side**: API-only backend (what we're keeping)
2. **Client-side**: Separate web application (future development)
3. **Storefront**: Client marketplace (future development)

## Expected Broken Links

After moving folders, these will need updating:
- All import statements in Go files
- Dockerfile COPY statements  
- CI/CD build paths
- Documentation references
- Docker compose service paths

This is expected and necessary for proper separation.

## 🎉 REFACTORING COMPLETE

All architectural refactoring objectives have been successfully achieved! The Mobius backend has been transformed from a monolithic structure into a clean, multi-product architecture.

### ✅ Objectives Achieved

#### 1. **Pure API Architecture** ✅
- **Server**: Focused entirely on REST APIs and device management
- **No Custom Agent**: Uses standard osquery and native MDM protocols
- **WebSocket Legitimacy**: Only for real-time API features (live queries, campaigns)
- **Frontend Cleanup**: Removed JavaScript mixing, kept only essential HTML status pages

#### 2. **Product Separation** ✅
- **Independent Modules**: Each product has its own go.mod and can be built separately
- **Clear Boundaries**: Server, CLI, Client, and Storefront are distinct products
- **API-Based Communication**: CLI communicates with server purely through REST APIs
- **Docker Images**: Separate images for each component plus combined option

#### 3. **"Internal" Designation Removed** ✅
- **Core Logic Exposed**: Moved from `backend/internal/server/` to `mobius-server/server/`
- **Import Paths Fixed**: All references updated throughout codebase
- **Build Validation**: All components build and run successfully

#### 4. **Client Logic Extracted** ✅
- **Load Testing Tool**: `mobius-client` is now a clean API-based testing client
- **Real Device Management**: Uses osquery agents and native MDM (no custom agent)
- **Clear Documentation**: README explains the testing purpose

#### 5. **Future-Ready Structure** ✅
- **Storefront Placeholder**: `mobius-cocoon` ready for marketplace development
