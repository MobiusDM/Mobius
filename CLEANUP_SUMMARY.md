- Preserved 37 different tool directories including:
  - Release automation (`release/`)
  - CI/CD tools (`ci/`)
  - Database utilities (`dbutils/`, `backup_db/`)
  - Docker builders (`mobius-docker/`, `mobiuscli-docker/`)
  - Package management (`mobiuscli-npm/`)
  - Infrastructure (`terraform/`)
  - And many more specialized tools

### 3. **Deployment Migration** ✅
- Moved `backend/deployments/` → `deployments/`
- Preserved Ansible configurations
- Preserved Kubernetes charts
- Preserved IT security scripts (macOS extensions, MDM migration, etc.)

### 4. **Script Migration** ✅
- Moved `backend/scripts/` → `scripts/`
