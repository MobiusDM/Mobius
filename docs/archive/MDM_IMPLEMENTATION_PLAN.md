# Mobius MDM Implementation Plan
*Created: August 13, 2025*
*Status: Active Development*

## Executive Summary
Transform the current skeleton codebase into a fully functional MDM platform by fixing critical incompatibilities, implementing missing core features, and ensuring end-to-end functionality.

## Current State Assessment
- ✅ Code structure exists and compiles
- ❌ CLI-Server API incompatibility (blocking all CLI operations)
- ❌ Unit tests failing with compilation errors
- ❌ Mock services instead of real implementations
- ❌ No verified end-to-end functionality
- ❌ GitHub workflows untested

## Implementation Strategy
**Priority Order**: Fix blocking issues → Build core functionality → Verify integration → Production readiness

---

## Phase 1: Critical Fixes ✅ COMPLETE

### 1.1 CLI-Server API Compatibility ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] Fix CLI authentication endpoints to match server routes
- [x] Implement legacy `/api/latest/mobius/*` compatibility layer
- [x] Test CLI login and license status commands working end-to-end
- [x] **Status**: CLI login working, license status working, all API routes compatible

### 1.2 Critical Compilation Errors ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] Fix all service test failures in pkg/service
- [x] Resolve any remaining import issues
- [x] Ensure all basic service interfaces work
- [x] **Status**: All service tests passing, device enrollment/search working correctly

### 1.3 Final Compilation Cleanup ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] Fix any remaining EOF and compilation errors
- [x] Ensure mobius-server builds and tests pass completely
- [x] Verify no remaining critical blocking issues
- [x] **Status**: All tests passing, database package implemented, command structure fixed

### 1.3 Implement Basic Authentication System
**Issue**: Mock auth with hardcoded passwords
**Tasks**:
- [ ] Replace mock auth with configurable user system
- [ ] Implement proper password hashing (bcrypt)
- [ ] Add JWT token generation and validation
- [ ] Create user management API endpoints
- [ ] Add setup/initialization endpoint for first admin user

**Acceptance Criteria**: Secure login with configurable credentials

## PHASE 2: CORE FUNCTIONALITY (Priority: HIGH)
*Goal: Implement essential MDM operations*

### 2.1 Device Management Core
**Tasks**:
- [ ] Replace mock device service with database-backed implementation
- [ ] Implement device enrollment workflows
- [ ] Add device discovery and inventory
- [ ] Create device status monitoring
- [ ] Implement device search and filtering (fix current test failures)

**Acceptance Criteria**: Devices can enroll, report status, and be managed through API

### 2.2 Policy Management System
**Tasks**:
- [ ] Replace mock policy service with real implementation
- [ ] Define policy schema and validation
- [ ] Implement policy assignment to devices/groups
- [ ] Add policy enforcement mechanisms
- [ ] Create policy compliance reporting

**Acceptance Criteria**: Policies can be created, assigned, and enforced on devices

### 2.3 Application Management
**Tasks**:
- [ ] Replace mock application service
- [ ] Implement app installation/removal workflows
- [ ] Add application inventory tracking
- [ ] Create app store integration capabilities
- [ ] Implement app policy enforcement

**Acceptance Criteria**: Applications can be deployed and managed remotely

---

## PHASE 3: INTEGRATION & TESTING (Priority: MEDIUM)
*Goal: Ensure all components work together reliably*

### 3.1 OSQuery Integration
**Tasks**:
- [ ] Implement real OSQuery client communication
- [ ] Add query scheduling and execution
- [ ] Create result collection and storage
- [ ] Implement real-time query capabilities
- [ ] Add OSQuery agent management

**Acceptance Criteria**: OSQuery queries execute and return real system data

### 3.2 Fix Unit Test Suite
**Tasks**:
- [ ] Fix all compilation errors in tests
- [ ] Implement proper test data and mocks
- [ ] Fix device service search logic bugs
- [ ] Add comprehensive test coverage for new features
- [ ] Create integration test suite

**Acceptance Criteria**: Test suite passes with >80% coverage

### 3.3 CLI Command Integration
**Tasks**:
- [ ] Verify all CLI commands work with real server
- [ ] Implement missing CLI functionality
- [ ] Add proper error handling and user feedback
- [ ] Create CLI configuration management
- [ ] Add command completion and help system

**Acceptance Criteria**: All documented CLI commands function properly

---

## PHASE 4: PRODUCTION READINESS (Priority: MEDIUM)
*Goal: Make system deployable and maintainable*

### 4.1 Database Integration
**Tasks**:
- [ ] Replace in-memory storage with persistent database
- [ ] Implement database migrations
- [ ] Add connection pooling and error handling
- [ ] Create backup and recovery procedures
- [ ] Optimize database queries and indexes

### 4.2 Security Hardening
**Tasks**:
- [ ] Implement rate limiting and request validation
- [ ] Add HTTPS/TLS configuration
- [ ] Create role-based access control (RBAC)
- [ ] Implement audit logging
- [ ] Add security headers and CORS configuration

### 4.3 Deployment & Monitoring
**Tasks**:
- [ ] Fix and verify GitHub workflows
- [ ] Create Docker production images
- [ ] Add health monitoring and metrics
- [ ] Implement logging and alerting
- [ ] Create deployment documentation

---

## PHASE 5: ADVANCED FEATURES (Priority: LOW)
*Goal: Add enterprise-grade capabilities*

### 5.1 Multi-Platform Support
**Tasks**:
- [ ] Implement Windows MDM integration
- [ ] Add macOS DEP/ABM support  
- [ ] Create Android Enterprise integration
- [ ] Add Linux agent management
- [ ] Implement cross-platform policy translation

### 5.2 Advanced Management
**Tasks**:
- [ ] Add certificate management
- [ ] Implement VPN profile distribution
- [ ] Create software update management
- [ ] Add remote desktop/assistance
- [ ] Implement geofencing and compliance
