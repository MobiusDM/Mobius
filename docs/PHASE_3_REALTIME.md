# Phase 3: Real-time Features Implementation Plan

## Overview
Implementing WebSocket support for real-time device status updates, live monitoring, and event streaming.

## Architecture Design

### WebSocket Server
- **Location**: `mobius-server/pkg/websocket/`
- **Protocol**: Standard WebSocket (RFC 6455)
- **Authentication**: JWT token-based (same as REST API)
- **Message Format**: JSON with event types

### Event Types
```json
{
  "type": "device_status_change",
  "timestamp": "2025-01-22T13:50:00Z",
  "data": {
    "device_id": "uuid",
    "old_status": "online",
    "new_status": "offline"
  }
}
```

### Implementation Steps

#### Step 1: WebSocket Infrastructure
- [ ] WebSocket server setup with Gorilla WebSocket
- [ ] Connection management and client registry
- [ ] Authentication middleware for WebSocket connections
- [ ] Message broadcasting system

#### Step 2: Event System
- [ ] Event publisher/subscriber pattern
- [ ] Device status change events
- [ ] Policy assignment events
- [ ] Command execution status events

#### Step 3: Integration
- [ ] Integrate with existing services
- [ ] Real-time status updates in device service
- [ ] Live command execution tracking
- [ ] Group membership change notifications

## Next Session Tasks
1. Implement WebSocket server infrastructure
2. Add real-time device status tracking
3. Create event broadcasting system
4. Test real-time functionality
