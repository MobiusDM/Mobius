## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### Service Layer Pattern:
```
API Layer (handlers) → Service Layer (business logic) → Data Layer (repositories)
```

### Key Components:
- **Authentication Service**: JWT token management
- **Device Service**: Device lifecycle management
- **Policy Service**: Policy creation and assignment
- **Device Group Service**: Group management and assignment
- **Application Service**: App lifecycle management
- **License Service**: License validation and management

### Data Flow:
1. HTTP Request → Router → Middleware (Auth) → Handler
2. Handler → Service Layer → Business Logic Validation
3. Service → Data Layer → Response Formation
4. Response → JSON → HTTP Response
