## Validation

### Automated Checks
- **PR Title Validation**: All PRs to main are automatically checked for conventional commit format
- **Individual Commits**: Advisory checking of individual commits (not enforced)

### Local Development
To validate commits locally:

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Check your last commit:
   ```bash
   npm run commitlint
   ```

## Rationale

1. **Consistent History**: Maintains a clean, searchable git history
2. **Automated Tooling**: Enables automatic changelog generation and semantic versioning
3. **Clear Intent**: Makes it immediately clear what type of change was made
4. **Release Notes**: Facilitates automatic generation of release notes

## Examples

### Good PR Titles ✅
- `feat: implement device enrollment API`
- `fix(server): resolve database connection timeout`
- `docs: add conventional commits documentation`
- `chore(deps): bump Go modules to latest versions`
- `test: add integration tests for MDM endpoints`

### Bad PR Titles ❌
- `Update server` (missing type)
- `Fix bug` (too vague)
- `Feat: Add Feature` (capitalized subject)
- `fix server issues.` (ends with period)
- `WIP: working on auth` (work in progress)
