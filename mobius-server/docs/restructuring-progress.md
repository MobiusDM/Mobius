# Mobius Backend Restructuring Progress

## Completed Changes

1. **Directory Structure Restructuring**
   - Moved service files from `server/service` to `internal/server/service`
   - Moved MDM-related files to appropriate locations
   - Updated import paths to reflect the new structure

2. **Import Path Updates**
   - Updated import paths in multiple files to use `internal/server/mobius` instead of `backend/server/mobius`
   - Updated other import paths to use the new directory structure

3. **Test Helper Updates**
   - Extended the `mdmtest` package with additional fields and methods to support testing
   - Added missing functionality to the test clients

4. **Removed Old/Duplicate Files**
   - Removed files from the old directory structure that have been moved to the new location
   - Removed duplicate files to avoid confusion

## Remaining Issues

1. **osquery-perf Tool**
   - The osquery-perf tool requires substantial updates to work with the new architecture
   - Detailed issues are documented in `docs/osquery-perf-fixes.md`
   - May require rewriting critical sections rather than individual fixes

2. **OrbitClient References**
   - Many parts of the code still reference `OrbitClient` which no longer exists
   - These should be updated to use the new `Client` functionality or removed

3. **Build Issues**
   - Some build errors remain due to type mismatches and undeclared variables
   - These will need to be addressed on a case-by-case basis

## Next Steps

1. Fix the remaining issues in the osquery-perf tool according to the documentation
2. Update any code that still uses `orbit` references
3. Fix remaining build errors
4. Add tests to verify the functionality of the updated code
5. Document the new architecture and usage patterns

The major restructuring of the Mobius backend has made significant progress, with most files now correctly located in the new directory structure. The remaining issues are primarily in the osquery-perf tool and other specialized utilities.
